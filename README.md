# ARRAY_PART_1
Arrays in Java      In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated. (discussed below)     Arrays may be stored in contiguous memory [consecutive memory locations].     Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. This is different from C/C++, where we find length using sizeof.
